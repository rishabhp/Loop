An android app with realtime Video (incomplete)

Native android mobile application that connects a person to strangers across the world over video. So once John is on the app, he'll get connected to others over a short video call where he can talk to them and decide whether or not he likes the other party or not. If there's a mutual like then that'll create a connection. On a dislike/skip he'll be connected to the next person.

Used WebRTC, WebSockets, etc. to build features like video/audio calling, realtime chat, etc.
